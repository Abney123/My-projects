multiple_sum = 0  # Sets a variable which will later be the answer to the problem
for i in range(1000):  # Starts a for loop to iterate through every integer between from 0 to 999 (Due to the specified number being excluded)
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:  # A nested if statement to check if the current integer is a multiple of 3 or 5 (The % meaning modulo so checks if there is a remainder)
        multiple_sum += i  # Adds the current integer to the multiple_sum variable if it is a multiple of 3 or 5 (+= is a simplified way of wrighting multiple_sum + i)
print(multiple_sum)  # Prints the final answer after the for loop has finished iterating!
